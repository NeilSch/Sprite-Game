Your program will be responsible for creating a Sprite with the following interactions:

Idle animation
Walk North (Movement)
Walk South (Movement)
Walk East (Movement)
Walk West (Movement)
For each "(Movement)" action listed above, your Sprite needs to play the associated animation sequence as well as move on the screen in the specified direction. You can use keyboard, or mouse inputs to direct your Sprite across thee screen.

Upon execution of your game, the Sprite should be interactive to the user's input. [↑←→↓] or mouse interaction should guide your Sprite around the screen:

YOU MUST IMPLEMENT SCREEN BOUNDARIES 
That is.. If the Sprite meets the screen boundaries, it should stop.

Provided below is an example of a Sprite asset. It contains images and meta information that we will discuss in class. You are welcome to create/buy your own Sprites. 
You can use python, html, css, javascript, java, or C++ to complete the assignment, but you are not allowed to:

Copy from anyone else's code
Copy form any online resource
Use any "game" libraries 
Vectors in C++ is fine
Use any code generation services, facilities, or people
